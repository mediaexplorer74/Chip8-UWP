## Description

Working Chip-8 interpreter / emulator running under the Universal Windows Platform with Win2D

This project demonstrates the CanvasAnimatedControl update cycle and drawing pixels as rectangles with DrawRectangle as well as picking files with FileOpenPicker.

Pull requests are always welcome.


Note that this does not include any Chip-8 ROMs. These can be had from many places, for example : http://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8.html

## Keys

1, 2, 3, 4

q, w, e, r

a, s, d, f

z, x, c, v

You'll have to work out which is which per game. Generally '2' and 'w' are 'fire' and either side of that are directional input but don't hold me to that.
